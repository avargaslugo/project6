# Trusted Pharma Supply Chain 
The goal is of this project is to build a supply chain tracking system with that protects cutomers and producers agains counterfeit pharmaceuticals. The main idea is that every single box (down to a single antibiotics treatment) is tracked at all times in the supply chain. Drugs are produced by a pharmaceutical company with a retailer already assign and knowing before hand who the distributor will be. Only the assigned distributor identified by it's address is allowed to pick up a drug an take it to the assigned reailer. Also only the assigned retailer is allowed to recive the drug from the distributor and seller to the consumer. The goal is to remove untrusted third parties and to warranty that a product cannot be cloned or resold. Once the drug has been bought by a consumer it's considered outside the trusted supply chain.
